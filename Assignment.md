This is a dynamic implementation of the 8 star assignment.  

You can create a custom board with any numbers and run the program and it will give you the solution.

To run this project,

1.  UnZip the project.
2.  Open up your preferred IDE.
3.  Import the project.
4.  Navigate to Main.java (because that's the where main method is). 
5.  Run the program.  The output will be displayed in the console.     


In Main.java, the line String startState = easyBoard; is where the program knows which board to use. 
You can select any of the options given to you or just create your own board with String anyNumbersYouWant = "";

The solution keeps changing, what I've written in my report is subject to be different when ran on the console.
